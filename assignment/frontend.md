# Frontend

## Used technologies

It was suggested in the Software Design page of the assignment information that the frontend should be written in JavaScript. I was already familiar with node-js and with its REACT.js framework so I used these.

The biggest advantage of REACT.js is the sheer amount of useful third-party libraries and components that are free to use without any licensing issues. Having to design an interactive floor plan I found a component called react-image-mapper \([https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-image-mapper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-image-mapper)\). Highcharts \([https://www.highcharts.com](https://www.highcharts.com/)\) was used for displaying the historical values. Bootstrap \([https://getbootstrap.com](https://getbootstrap.com/)\) provided the necessary UI elements like forms, selectors, buttons and also the layout.
