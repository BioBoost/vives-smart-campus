# Reflection

**The PCB:**

To start the communication between Gary, Lennert and I went well. We worked on a fast tempo during the holidays. Also the communication with the teachers went well. Also as students and with the use of circuit maker \(a new program for us\), we did not lost a lot of time. But we had to do it a little bit different. 

* The day we started drawing the schematic was too late.
* We had to make a pcb on a breadboard before making a full PCB.
* Testing of the components had to be done a lot earlier

In my opinion it was a good learning proces for us three and we learned a lot about components, drawing schematics and placing those components on the right place. But we have to say, we had a lot of luck that our first PCB was working properly.
