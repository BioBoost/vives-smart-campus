## Docker

Docker is a service that allows the creation and running of containers based on images defined by developers. Containers package software into standardized units for development, shipment and deployment. A container image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package of a piece of software that includes everything needed to run it: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, settings. Available for both Linux and Windows based apps, containerized software will always run the same, regardless of the environment. Containers isolate software from its surroundings, for example differences between development and staging environments and help reduce conflicts between teams running different software on the same infrastructure.

For this project all above components should be placed inside containers creating a clear separation and also allowing them to be hosted on any machine / server of our liking. So basically you need at least 5 container images. A server will be made available by us. Later on container hosting will also be provided by us.

## Unified Modeling Language

The **Unified Modeling Language** \(UML\) methodology could be very useful to manage, design and maintain the global and partial parts of the software project \(an example is shown in the image below\). In a transparent and clear manner the structure \(attributes and behavior\) and relations between classes is visualized. This is a rather powerful tool for supporting the process of software development.

The following UML diagrams should be used to explain the development and results:

* Class diagram
* User stories
* Sequence diagrams
* Flowcharts
* State diagram
