# Reflection

## **The PCB:**

\(Gary, Lennert and Robbe\)  
To start the collaboration while designing the PCB went well. This is partly because circuit maker is very handy while working with multiple people. We worked on a fast tempo during the holidays. We got a lot of very usefull tips from the teachers and the communication with  them went well. Also as students and new to circuit maker, we haven't lost a lot of time considering we had to start over multiple times because of last term changes. 

Items we should have done \(earlier\):

* The day we started drawing the schematic was too late.
* We had to make a pcb on a breadboard before making a full PCB.
* Testing of the components had to be done a lot earlier

Things we learned making the PCB:

* The use of short traces on the groundplane is required to maintain/ ensure its bnefits
* The usage of a VCO results in a lot of loss of energy to heat and this makes the print less energy efficient  \(with bad placement of components this can result in measuring wrong temperatures\)
* It is necessary to place a fuse after the VCO to prevent accidents \(eg. fire\) if it breaks down.

It was a good learning proces for us three and we learned a lot of new things about components, drawing schematics and placing those components on the right place.

## The firmware:

\(Daan, Elias, Lennert, Joni,...\)

Items we should have done \(earlier\):

* We started to late with the design of our firmware.
* We had to test the firmware class by class and not everyting at once.

Things that didn't go well:

* There are still some small bugs in the code but all parts work but there is a small bug in the communiction between some classes.
* Some classes aren't OOP oriented.
* Some classes or methods contain pieces of code that shouldn't be in that class or method.

  
Things we learned making the firmware:

* I \(Daan\) learned a lot about C++ and OOP concepts.
* I \(Daan\) learned a lot about how to trouble shout and find problems.

##  Laravel backend

\(Steve\)

MVC, ORM, JWT, CSRF, XSS is no longer chinese for me,  but there is still a lot to learn about it.

## Database

\(Steve\)

I used a SQL database, but next time i would choose a NoSQL database to learn more about it.
