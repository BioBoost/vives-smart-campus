# Reflection

## **The PCB**

\(Gary, Lennert and Robbe\)  
To start the collaboration while designing the PCB went well. This is partly because circuit maker is very handy while working with multiple people. We worked on a fast tempo during the holidays. We got a lot of very usefull tips from the teachers and the communication with  them went well. Also as students and new to circuit maker, we haven't lost a lot of time considering we had to start over multiple times because of last term changes. 

Items we should have done \(earlier\):

* The day we started drawing the schematic was too late.
* We had to make a pcb on a breadboard before making a full PCB.
* Testing of the components had to be done a lot earlier

Things we learned making the PCB:

* The use of short traces on the groundplane is required to maintain/ ensure its bnefits
* The usage of a VCO results in a lot of loss of energy to heat and this makes the print less energy efficient  \(with bad placement of components this can result in measuring wrong temperatures\)
* It is necessary to place a fuse after the VCO to prevent accidents \(eg. fire\) if it breaks down.

It was a good learning proces for us three and we learned a lot of new things about components, drawing schematics and placing those components on the right place.

## The firmware

\(Daan, Elias, Lennert, Joni ...\)

Items we should have done \(earlier\):

* We started to late with the design of our firmware.
* We had to test the firmware class by class and not everyting at once.

Things that didn't go well:

* There are still some small bugs in the code but all parts work but there is a small bug in the communiction between some classes.
* Some classes aren't OOP oriented.
* Some classes or methods contain pieces of code that shouldn't be in that class or method.

  
Things we learned making the firmware:

* I \(Daan\) learned a lot about C++ and OOP concepts.
* I \(Daan\) learned a lot about how to trouble shout and find problems.
* And I \(Elias\) have the same opinion / experience as Daan. I learned a lot about C++ and have become comfortable with the C++ langauge.

## Measurements

It was difficult at first to figure out how I should calculate and take account of everything.

But after some effort it was no problem anymore.

## LoRaWAN

\(Elias\)

At first, I was scared to take the task of the LoRaWAN. But it quickly became very easy to use.

In further projects I would definitely use LoRaWAN if its suited for the problem.

##  Laravel backend

\(Steve\)

MVC, ORM, JWT, CSRF, XSS is no longer chinese for me,  but there is still alot to learn about it.

## Database

\(Steve\)

I used a SQL database, but next time i would chose a NoSQL database to learn more about it.

## GraphQL API

\(Aython\)

I made a GraphQL API for the laravel backend.

Things I learned:

* I learned a lot of GraphQL and laravel.
* I also learned something about mutations in graphQL

## Frontend

\(Gabriel\)

Things that didn't go well:

* Designing the application with mobile layout in mind.
* Making the application resizable. 

  
Things I learned:

* Working with more of React.js components.
* Mapping over images.
* Importance of setting doable goals for the foreseeable future for project.
